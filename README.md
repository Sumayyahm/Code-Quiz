# Code-Quiz
In the code quiz app,
I have written functions that,
1. that displays quiz questions and sets a timer when the start quiz button is clicked
2. The user is notified when he/she selects the right answer 
3. Selecting the wrong answer reduces the score by -10
4. When the questions are over or timer is up, the final score is displayed
